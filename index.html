    <h1>THIS IS A TEST TO SEE IF WE CAN USE ALT + B TO OPEN IN BROWSER</h1>
    <h3>...and YES! We successfully opened in the browser without having
        the browser extention feature enabled!!
    <br>
    ... and btw, on a mac you type option + b (instead) of alt... and 
        don't forget you must type com + s to save the latest version.
    </h3>

    <h2>and another thing... commit often!</h2>
    <p>committ after each change so that you have incremental versions you can revert to if need be.</p>
<!-- <   </header> -->
    <p> ps.  you don't have to open another browser 
        window to see your edits, <br> simply go to your page and 
       type command + r to refresh.. ok, that's it for now!</p>

       <p><strong>Would you like to learn more about anchor links? Touch the link below. And remember...</strong></p>
        <!-- You'll see below that href is actually an attribute as it provides more information about the anchor element. It 
        is telling the browser when the user clicks this content (exists btwn <a> tags and displays
        on the page to the user) then take them to the html reference,or rather link -->
        <a href ="https://html.com/anchors-links/" target = "_blank"> whatever is btwn these anchor tags appears to the user </a>
        <br>
        <a href ="#">An href link with a value of "#" is known as a placeholder link and won't actually go anywhere 
            but the top of the page (and refresh the page). </a>
        </a>
    <p>Many excellent keyboard shortcuts when coding as learned by
        session #2 of NB class... let's list them below; </p>
    <p>Many valuable lessons learned about pseudo-styling... I would need
        to create a css document and link to this in order to make it work.. refer
        to the pseudo-code directory inside the development directory. 
    </p>

        <!-- ** NOTE ** src, href and target are all ATTRIBUTES... the value is what follows the = is the value assigned to that attribute.
        The target = "_blank" is flagging
        the browser that we want to open this link to open in a new tab. 
        Purpose of attributes is to tell you info about element. You can give
        identifiers, or give it a class... more on this later-->
        <ul>
            <li>To open a new file in VS code, type command + N (new)</li>
            <li>Instead of right clicking to open in browser, type Alt/Option +B (browser)</li>
            <li>To refresh changes made in html file, go to page already in progress and type command + R (refresh)</li>
            <li>Always be saving... you can change this globally to auto save but best practices would be command +S</li>
            <li>This is not a shortcut but worth noting that if you want your href to open in a new tab its <br>
            important to type    target = "_blank" after the address. That way, the user will stay on your page!</li>
